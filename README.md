# Portfolio Website ðŸŽ¨

Welcome to my **Portfolio Website**, built using **Next.js**, **Framer Motion**, and **Tailwind CSS**! This project showcases my skills, experience, and personal projects with a clean, interactive, and responsive design. I leveraged **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and **Next.js** for efficient server-side rendering.

## ðŸš§ Project in Progress

This project is a **work in progress**! While the website is fully functional, there are still a few features and improvements I plan to implement:

- **Deploying** the portfolio on **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
- **Adding more personal projects** and case studies.
- Enhancing the **user experience** with additional animations and interactive elements.
- **Integrating a contact form** for potential collaborations or job offers.

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or above)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Steps to Run Locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sapanaa/-Portfolio.git

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
